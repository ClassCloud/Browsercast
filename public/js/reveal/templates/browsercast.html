        And if you want something people can replay, you have to make a screencast,
        which is also opaque to search engines and disability aids,
        and probably several times larger than your original slides.

        Browsercast is our solution to this problem.
	It lets you edit a slideshow and synchronize it with a pre-recorded soundtrack.

        What's more,
        since a browsercast is just HTML and audio,
	you can restyle it with CSS,
        and it's a fraction of the size of a video screencast.

	based on earlier prototypes by David Seifried, Jeremy Banks, David Wolever, and Tavish Armstrong.
