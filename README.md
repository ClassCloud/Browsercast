Browsercast
===========

The Browsercast project aims to offer a web based slideshow composition tool with support for voice-over synchronization

Presentation will offer full playback functionality: play/stop/pause/resume with perfect voice-over synchronization like a video but will maintain the same rich web environment: text, images, links, interactivity.
